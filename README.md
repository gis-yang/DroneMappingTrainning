**Course description**

This open-access drone mapping training course is designed to use  Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), i.e. UAV or drones to collect remote sensing data for coastal mapping and seagrass conservation. We create this training course for research partners and broader communities to learn how to fly drone , and perform the data processing in Geographical Information Science (GIS) method. This training course contains topics of flying DJI drones, Preflight & Planning, FAA part 107 examination, Drone2map user guide, and GIS based drone image analyses.

### Register your drone

In the event that the FAA needs to identify a drone in the United States, they will utilize your FAA registration number to seek information. It only takes about 10 minutes to register, and failure to do so can result in extreme repercussions from the FAA.
 
“Failure to register with the FAA could result in one or a combination of the following: a civil penalty of up to $27,500; a criminal fine of up to $250,000; imprisonment for up to three years.” - FAA

Directions for Registering Drone with FAA:
1.	Go to https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/
2.	Click “Register” in the same row as “I fly under Part 107 or as a Public Aircraft.”
3.	Enter information and click “Create Account.”
4.	Verify your email address and log in
5.	Make sure that you are in the “Part 107 Dashboard.”
6.	Click “Manage sUAS Inventory.”
7.	Click “Add UAS.”
8.	Fill out the information
9.	Enter your drone’s unique serial number, as found in the battery cavity of the drone: 
10.	Go to “Shopping Cart” and click “Checkout.”
11.	Follow prompts for payment
12.	Navigate back to your “FAA Part 107 Dashboard” and click “Manage sUAS Inventory”
13.	Find the drone that you registered and find the “Registration” column. 
14.	Mark your drone with the registration number according to the following FAA Parameters:
	*	The unique identifier must be maintained in a condition that is legible.
	*	The unique identifier must be affixed to the small unmanned aircraft by any means necessary to ensure that it will remain affixed for the duration of each operation.
	*	The unique identifier must be legibly displayed on an external surface of the small unmanned aircraft.


# 2. In-Flight Operation
* Before flights, the remote pilot needs to check gloves, eye protection, safety vests, radio, and life jacket if taking off from a boat. 
* During the flights, wthe UAV needs to remain within visual line of sight of the remote pilot.
* The flight is not permitted directly over non-participating people.   
* Because coastal mapping with drones often includes taking off and landing on a boat, additional procedures and safety concerns were discussed.

### Air Space Regulation
* all drones are required to be registered with the FAA if they weigh more than 0.55 lbs (250 grams) and less than 55 lbs (25 kg). 
* When operating a drone, a Remote Pilot-in-Command cannot fly an UAV higher than 400 feet above ground level (AGL), unless it’s flown within a 400-foot radius of a structure and does not fly higher than 400 feet above the structure’s immediate uppermost limit. 
* The minimum distance of the UAS from clouds must be no less than 500 feet below the cloud and 2,000 feet horizontally from the cloud. 

For more FAA regulation, please read [FAA remote pilot study guide](/Documents/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf)

# 3. Autonomous Mapping

 [Advance drone flying](/Documents/CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_Document.pdf)
*	Read the “CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_Document” in the course material, learn to use DJI GS Pro app for auto-pilot and safety guidelines. 
*	2-hour practice flying via auto-pilot with the help of TA, collecting images for mapping, and transfer all images from drone to computer.

### Mapping planning & settings

Participants learned how to plan and create a new flight area using autonomous flights with different mapping parameters. Training covered: 
* tradeoffs between spatial coverage and spatial resolution (e.g. if drones fly at a higher elevation, the image coverage is larger, but the spatial resolution is coarser and vice versa); 
* appropriate settings of the camera model for a proper shooting angle to minimize sun glint; 
* how flight direction and capture mode varies depending on the shape of the site and the wind directions; 
* how front/side overlap ratio is highly correlated with flying time and the number of batteries needed. The values to be used for addressing those factors are included in Table 1.

# 4. Image Processing

### Drone Image stitching

 [Processing the drone imagery to mapping products](/Documents/CSGIS_Drone2map_User_Guide.pdf)

*	Learn the “CSGIS_Drone2map User Guide”.
*	1-hour lab session for drone2Map data processing.
Note: Drone2Map software package could be downloaded from course material resources folder. Sample data are provided in course folder.

**Geo-referencing**

For points on land, we used obvious objects, such as red buckets that could be easily identified in the drone image. For image referencing over the water, we used light-colored buoys with anchors fixed on the water surface to serve as the Ground Control Point (GCP). Using a Garmin R1 GNSS high-performance handheld GPS, we collected about 10 points for each of the sites. The coordinates of the GCPs are included in the mapping software to geo-register the images. By associating features on the scanned image with real-world x and y coordinates, the software can progressively warp the image so it fits other spatial datasets. 


### Orthomosaic & Elevation Data

 [Data analysis in Geographical Information Science (GIS)](/Documents/CSGIS_ArcGIS_based_Image_Analyses_Manual.pdf)
*	Learn the “CSGIS_ ArcGIS based Image Analyses Manual”
*	1-hour lab session for GIS analysis on drone imagery, digitizing, multi-spectral band math, vegetation index and image classification.
Note: ArcMap software package could be downloaded from course material resources folder. Sample data are provided in course folder.

# 5. Post-training Self-study

### Self-study for FAA UAS Exam

In order to fly drones under the FAA’s Small UAS Rule (Part 107) in the U.S.A., one must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA (FAA.gov). This certificate demonstrates that the remote pilot understands the regulations, operating requirements, and procedures for safely flying drones. 

[Self-study for FAA part 107 exam](/Documents/CSGIS_Instruction_for_FAA_Part_107_Examination.pdf)

Above training document reviewed content from the course modules as well as additional material necessary to prepare for the drone examination, including airspace concepts, weather sources, radio communications, sectional charts, and drone physics. It also includes additional online resources and sample questions for the examination.


### Data Processing Protocol 

 [Drone imagery and eelgrass mapping principles](/Slides/UAV_Traning_Slides_Yang.pptx)
*	40 minutes lecture for drone eelgrass mapping principles. 
*	30 minutes discussion followed by the lecture to discuss eelgrass drone mapping.
