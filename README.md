**Course description**
This open access drone mapping training course is design to be use in the NSF eelgrass drone mapping project. How to uses Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), i.e. drones, to do the mapping.  We create this training course for our eelgrass mapping friends to learn how to fly drone for collecting data, and perform the data analysis in Geographical Information Science (GIS) method. This training course contains topics of flying DJI drones, Preflight & Planning, FAA part 107 examination, Drone2map user guide, and ArcGIS based drone image analyses.


 **Course Objectives**
1.	Basic knowledge of Drone, setup and maintenance. 
2.	Learn how to fly drone, manual manipulation and auto-pilot.
3.	Learn FAA regulation, sectional chart, and how to take the part 107 exam.
4.	Safety guidlines when flying drone. 
5.	Learn to use DJI GS Pro for auto-pilot flying and collecting field data. 
6.	In situ measurements guide, collecting field data and Ground Control Points (GCPs).
7.	Use Esri Drone2Map to stitching and geo-referencing the drone imagery. 
8.	Data management and cloud storage of drone imagery
9.	Basic GIS analysis on drone imagery, digitizing, multi-spectral band math, vegetation index and image classification. 

## 1. Drone Basics

[Introduction to flying drone](/Documents/CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_and_Safety.pdf)
*	20 minutes lecture to drone and basic manipulation.
*	Read the “Phantom 4 user manual” in the course material and setup the drone.
*	1.5-hour practice fly with the help of TA, get familiar with drone manipulating, fly around and taking picture/video using the drone.

## 2. In-Flight Operation
We review the legal requirements when flying drones, including federal regulations which govern the safe use of drones in participant’s study regions (e.g., FAA part 107 in the USA, Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs). Part IX – Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems in Canada. Safety rules for flying drones are included in a written guide. We stress that before flights, the remote pilot needs to check gloves, eye protection, safety vests, radio, and life jacket if taking off from a boat. During the flights, we stress that the UAV needs to remain within visual line of sight of the remote pilot. The flight is not permitted directly over non-participating people.   it is possible to obtain a basic or advanced drone pilot license which differs in operational regulations and training required. Because coastal mapping with drones often includes taking off and landing on a boat, additional procedures and safety concerns were discussed. For example, hand catching of the drone on a boat was demonstrated and practiced for both takeoff and landing.  
### Drone Manipulation

### Air Space Regulation
In the U.S., all drones are required to be registered with the FAA if they weigh more than 0.55 lbs (250 grams) and less than 55 lbs (25 kg). When operating a drone, a Remote Pilot-in-Command cannot fly an UAV higher than 400 feet above ground level (AGL), unless it’s flown within a 400-foot radius of a structure and does not fly higher than 400 feet above the structure’s immediate uppermost limit. The minimum distance of the UAS from clouds must be no less than 500 feet below the cloud and 2,000 feet horizontally from the cloud. In Canada, a drone pilot certificate must be acquired in order to conduct basic operations (ie. Flights < 120 m ASL, maintain distance from bystanders (30 m),
## 3. Autonomous Mapping

 [Advance drone flying](/Documents/CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_Document.pdf)
*	Read the “CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_Document” in the course material, learn to use DJI GS Pro app for auto-pilot and safety guidelines. 
*	2-hour practice flying via auto-pilot with the help of TA, collecting images for mapping, and transfer all images from drone to computer.

### Autonomous Flight Planning

### Auto-fly Parameter Setting

## 4. Image Processing

### Drone Image stitching

 [Processing the drone imagery to mapping products](/Documents/CSGIS_Drone2map_User_Guide.pdf)

*	Learn the “CSGIS_Drone2map User Guide”.
*	1-hour lab session for drone2Map data processing.
Note: Drone2Map software package could be downloaded from course material resources folder. Sample data are provided in course folder.

### Geo-referencing

### Orthomosaic & Elevation Data

 [Data analysis in Geographical Information Science (GIS)](/Documents/CSGIS_ArcGIS_based_Image_Analyses_Manual.pdf)
*	Learn the “CSGIS_ ArcGIS based Image Analyses Manual”
*	1-hour lab session for GIS analysis on drone imagery, digitizing, multi-spectral band math, vegetation index and image classification.
Note: ArcMap software package could be downloaded from course material resources folder. Sample data are provided in course folder.

## 5. Post-training Self-study

### Self-study for FAA UAS Exam

	[Self-study for FAA part 107 exam](/Documents/CSGIS_Instruction_for_FAA_Part_107_Examination.pdf)
*	10-hours study for “CSGIS_Instruction for FAA Part 107 Examination” as well as “remote_pilot_study_guide” for taking the exam. There are also lots of resources online.


### Data Processing Protocol 

 [Drone imagery and eelgrass mapping principles](/Slides/UAV_Traning_Slides_Yang.pptx)
*	40 minutes lecture for drone eelgrass mapping principles. 
*	30 minutes discussion followed by the lecture to discuss eelgrass drone mapping.
